# My first RShiny App (from scratch)

This Shiny app was my weekend homework @ CodeClan to consolidate ggplot and RShiny, which we covered in one week.
This app uses a dataset from CodeClan data library, which I cannot share due to copyright restrictions. However the app functionality: filtered data table and different plotting options can be translated to accommodate any dataset.
